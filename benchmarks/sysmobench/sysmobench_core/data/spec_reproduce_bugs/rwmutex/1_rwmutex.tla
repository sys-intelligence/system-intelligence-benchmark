\* Reproduce Bug: https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas/issues/1303

EXTENDS Naturals, Sequences, FiniteSets, TLC

\* Constants --------------------------------------------------------------
\* Threads: finite set of worker identities to explore.
\* MaxReaders: upper bound corresponding to MAX_READER in the implementation.
CONSTANTS Threads, MaxReaders

\* A distinguished value used when no thread occupies a role.
NoThread == "NoThread"

\* Operation tags covering the three public lock calls plus upgrade spin.
Ops == {"Read", "Write", "Upread", "Upgrade"}

\* Thread lifecycle buckets we will refine in the state machine.
ThreadPhases ==
    {"Idle", "ReadHolding", "ReadWaiting",
     "WriteHolding", "WriteWaiting",
     "UpreadHolding", "UpreadWaiting",
     "UpgradeSpinning", "DowngradeInFlight"}

\* Derived domain helpers.
ThreadRoleDomain == Threads \cup {NoThread}
ReaderCountDomain == 0 .. MaxReaders

\* Typing helpers for structured state components.
LockRecord ==
    [ writerOwner: ThreadRoleDomain,
      upgradableOwner: ThreadRoleDomain,
      upgradingOwner: ThreadRoleDomain,
      readerCount: ReaderCountDomain ]

WaitEntry ==
    [ tid: Threads,
      op: Ops ]

ThreadStateRecord ==
    [ phase: ThreadPhases,
      readHolds: Nat,
      queuedOp: Ops \cup {"None"} ]

WaitQueueState == Seq(WaitEntry)

\* Variables --------------------------------------------------------------
\* lock: snapshot of the atomic bitfield decoded into explicit roles.
\* waitQueue: abstract FIFO capturing the single WaitQueue in the code.
\* threadState: per-thread bookkeeping for acquisitions and pending ops.
\* pendingWakeUps: set of threads that have been woken but not yet retried.
\* expectedWakeUps: ghost set tracking threads that must observe a wake event.
\* enqueueEpoch: ghost counter recording each thread's enqueue round.
\* wakeEpoch: ghost counter recording successful wakes per thread.
\* upgradeEpoch: ghost counter limiting per-hold upgrade/downgrade cycles.
VARIABLES lock, waitQueue, threadState, pendingWakeUps, expectedWakeUps, enqueueEpoch, wakeEpoch, upgradeEpoch
