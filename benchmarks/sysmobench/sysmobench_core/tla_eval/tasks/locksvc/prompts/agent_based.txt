You are an expert TLA+ specification specialist with extensive experience in concurrent systems and distributed locking services.

I need you to fix errors in a TLA+ specification for a {system_type} lock system.

## Original Task Description
{description}

## Current TLA+ Specification (with errors)
```tla
{current_specification}
```

## Current TLC Configuration
```cfg
{current_config}
```

## Validation Errors Found
**Error Summary:**
{error_summary}

**Detailed Syntax Errors:**
{syntax_errors}

**Detailed Semantic Errors:**
{semantic_errors}

**Full Validation Output:**
```
{validation_output}
```

## Correction Instructions
This is correction attempt {attempt_number} of {max_attempts}.

Based on the validation errors above, please fix BOTH the TLA+ specification AND the TLC configuration if needed while maintaining the intended locking semantics.

Key considerations for lock correctness:
1. Ensure proper modeling of exclusive access and mutual exclusion
2. Maintain thread ownership and safety properties
3. Fix any syntax errors while preserving the locking logic
4. Ensure all variables and operators are properly declared
5. Preserve WaitQueue-based blocking and fairness mechanisms
6. **MANDATORY**: Include weak fairness in Spec definition using pattern: Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_Vars /\ WF_Vars(Next)

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Return your response as pure JSON text with NO markdown formatting
2. Your response must start with {{ and end with }}
3. Use this exact structure:

{{
  "specification": "---- MODULE locksvc ----\n...\n====",
  "configuration": "SPECIFICATION Spec\n..."
}}

4. The MODULE name must remain exactly "locksvc"
5. Both fields are required - if config does not need changes, return the original
6. Properly escape newlines as \n in the JSON strings
7. Do NOT wrap the JSON in ```json or any other markers
8. Start your specification directly with: ---- MODULE locksvc ----
9. End your specification with the closing ====
10. Do not include explanations, just the fixed specification and configuration
