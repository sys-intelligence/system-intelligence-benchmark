You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in distributed systems and consensus protocols.

Convert the following ZooKeeper source code to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: ZooKeeper Fast Leader Election protocol
Focus: {focus}

Source Code from {file_path}:
```java
{source_code}
```

ZooKeeper leader election modeling requirements:

MANDATORY CORE ACTIONS (must include):
1. 【Election Notification】Notification exchange between servers
   - Servers broadcast their votes (epoch, leader, zxid)
   - Servers receive and compare votes
   - Vote comparison based on: epoch > zxid > server_id
2. 【State Transitions】Server state changes
   - LOOKING: actively participating in election
   - FOLLOWING: accepted another server as leader
   - LEADING: won the election
3. 【Vote Tracking】Track received votes and determine quorum
   - Collect votes from other servers
   - Check if candidate has quorum (majority)
4. 【Leader Selection】Determine winner based on vote comparison
   - Higher epoch wins
   - If epoch equal, higher zxid wins
   - If zxid equal, higher server_id wins

CRITICAL SEMANTIC DISTINCTION:
- **Fast Leader Election**: ZooKeeper's leader election algorithm
  * Each server proposes itself initially
  * Servers exchange votes and update based on comparison
  * Quorum-based decision (majority required)
  * Eventual convergence to single leader

- **Vote Comparison Logic**:
  * Compare (epoch, zxid, server_id) lexicographically
  * Higher values win
  * Ensures consistent leader selection

MODELING REQUIREMENTS:
- Model each server's state (LOOKING/FOLLOWING/LEADING)
- Track current epoch and voted leader for each server
- Model notification message passing between servers
- Track vote counts for quorum calculation

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (do not model):
- TCP/IP network details
- Message serialization format
- QuorumCnxManager implementation
- Thread synchronization details
- Actual data replication (focus on election only)

REQUIRED BEHAVIORAL SCOPE:
- Model at least: Notification action for vote exchange
- Show election process from LOOKING to convergence
- Demonstrate quorum-based leader selection
- Include epoch advancement scenarios

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "zookeeper" (---- MODULE zookeeper ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE zookeeper ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
6. **DO NOT define invariants** (like LeaderUniqueness, etc.) - focus on modeling the system behavior
7. **MANDATORY Spec Definition**: The Spec definition should include Init and Next, with fairness assumptions

## Trace Validation Conventions

To enable automated trace validation against real system traces, your specification MUST follow these naming conventions:

### MANDATORY: Action/Event Names
Your specification must use this EXACT action name to match trace events:

**Election Actions** (must appear in traces):
- `Notification` - Election vote exchange between servers (corresponds to trace "name" field)

### MANDATORY: State Variables
Your specification must include these state variables with EXACT names:

**Core Election State** (per server):
- `state` - Server state mapping: Server -> {LOOKING, FOLLOWING, LEADING}
- `currentEpoch` - Current election epoch: Server -> Nat
- `votedFor` - Current vote (proposed leader): Server -> Server
- `lastZxid` - Last transaction ID: Server -> Nat (used for vote comparison)

**Election Progress**:
- `votes` - Received votes for each server: Server -> SUBSET Server (for quorum tracking)

### Trace Event Structure
Real system traces will have this format:
```
{"name": "Notification", "nid": 0, "timestamp": 0, "to": 1, "term": 1, "leader": 0, "zxid": "0x100000000"}
```

Where:
- `name` - Action name (must be "Notification")
- `nid` - Sending server ID
- `to` - Receiving server ID
- `term` - Election epoch
- `leader` - Proposed leader in this vote
- `zxid` - Transaction ID for comparison

### Validation Matching Logic
During trace validation, the system will:
1. Match trace event "name" field to your TLA+ action "Notification"
2. Check that state variables (state, currentEpoch, votedFor, lastZxid) exist
3. Verify state transitions match trace sequences
4. Allow flexibility in other aspects of your specification

### Constants
Define these as CONSTANTS in your spec:
- `Server` - Set of server identifiers (e.g., {s0, s1, s2})
- `LOOKING`, `FOLLOWING`, `LEADING` - State constants
- `Quorum` - Majority subset of servers

## Final Reminders

- Use EXACT action name: Notification
- Use EXACT state variable names: state, currentEpoch, votedFor, lastZxid, votes
- DO NOT include invariants in the spec (they're added separately)
- Focus on BEHAVIOR modeling, not on proving properties
- Model the vote comparison logic correctly (epoch > zxid > server_id)

Generate a complete, compilable TLA+ specification that captures the core Fast Leader Election semantics while respecting the trace validation naming conventions.
