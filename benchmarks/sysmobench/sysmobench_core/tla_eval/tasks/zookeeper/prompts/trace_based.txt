You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in distributed systems, particularly ZooKeeper and leader election.

Convert the following traces from an execution of ZooKeeper to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: ZooKeeper Fast Leader Election
Focus: {focus}

Traces:
{traces}

Trace format interpretation:
{trace_format}

ZooKeeper-specific modeling requirements:

MANDATORY CORE ACTIONS (must include all):
1. 【Election Notification】Vote exchange messages between servers
2. 【State Transitions】Server states: LOOKING, FOLLOWING, LEADING
3. 【Vote Comparison】Compare votes based on (epoch, zxid, server_id) ordering
4. 【Quorum Detection】Track votes and determine majority
5. 【Leader Selection】Elect leader based on vote comparison rules

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (do not model):
- ZAB broadcast phase (PROPOSAL, COMMIT)
- Data synchronization (DIFF, TRUNC, SNAP)
- Client request handling
- Network layer details
- Transaction processing

REQUIRED BEHAVIORAL SCOPE:
- Notification message passing between servers
- State changes: LOOKING → FOLLOWING/LEADING
- Vote tracking and quorum calculation
- Epoch advancement rules
- Leader uniqueness guarantee
- Basic message delays and network partitions

Generate a TLA+ specification that accurately models ZooKeeper's leader election behavior.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "zookeeper" (---- MODULE zookeeper ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE zookeeper ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
6. **DO NOT define invariants** (like LeaderUniqueness, etc.) - focus on modeling the system behavior
7. **MUST include EXTENDS statement**: The specification must extend at least these modules: TLC, Sequences, Naturals, FiniteSets
