You are an expert Alloy specification specialist with extensive experience in concurrent systems and spinlock synchronization.

I need you to fix errors in an Alloy specification for a spinlock {system_type} system.

## Original Task Description
{description}

## Current Alloy Specification (with errors)
```alloy
{current_specification}
```

## Validation Errors Found
**Error Summary:**
{error_summary}

**Detailed Syntax Errors:**
{syntax_errors}

**Detailed Semantic Errors:**
{semantic_errors}

**Full Validation Output:**
```
{validation_output}
```

## Correction Instructions
This is correction attempt {attempt_number} of {max_attempts}.

Based on the validation errors above, please fix the Alloy specification to ensure it compiles correctly while maintaining the intended spinlock synchronization semantics.

Key considerations for spinlock correctness:
1. Ensure proper modeling of atomic test-and-set operations
2. Maintain mutual exclusion and safety properties
3. Fix any syntax errors while preserving the spinlock logic
4. Ensure all signatures, fields, and predicates are properly declared
5. Preserve dual API semantics: blocking lock() vs non-blocking try_lock()
6. Use `curr` and `next` for state variables (NOT `s` and `s'`)
7. Ensure all predicate parameters have explicit types (e.g., `pred Foo[s: State, t: Thread]`)

Common Alloy syntax issues to avoid:
- Variable names cannot contain single quotes (use `curr`, `next` instead of `s'`)
- Predicate parameters must have explicit types: `pred TryAcquire[s: State, s': State, ...]` NOT `pred TryAcquire[s, s': State, ...]`
- Use `lone` for "at most one" (e.g., `Lock -> lone Thread`)
- Use `one` for "exactly one" (e.g., `time: one Time`)
- Facts cannot have parameters (use predicates instead if parameters needed)

## Trace Validation Conventions

Ensure the corrected specification uses these exact names:

**Thread/Lock atoms**:
- `one sig Thread0, Thread1 extends Thread {{}}`
- `one sig Lock0 extends Lock {{}}`

**State fields**:
- `thread_status: Thread -> one Status`
- `lock_holder: Lock -> lone Thread`
- `time: one Time`

**Status values**:
- `abstract sig Status {{}}`
- `one sig Idle, Trying, Locked extends Status {{}}`

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The module name must remain exactly "spinlock" (module spinlock)
2. Return ONLY the corrected Alloy specification code - no markdown code blocks
3. Do not include explanations, just the fixed specification
4. Start your response directly with: module spinlock
5. Include proper `open util/ordering[Time]` statement
6. Include ONLY ONE run command for trace generation - DO NOT include any assertions or check commands

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any assertions (assert statements) or check commands in the corrected specification. These will be added separately during invariant verification phase.
