You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in concurrent systems and lock-free data structures.

Convert the following Asterinas OS RingBuffer traces to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: Asterinas OS lock-free SPSC ring buffer
Focus: {focus}

Traces:
{traces}

Trace format interpretation:
{trace_format}

RingBuffer modeling requirements:

MANDATORY CORE ACTIONS (must include all):
1. 【Producer Operations】Push and push_slice operations with atomicity
   - push(): single item enqueue (check full → write → advance tail)
   - push_slice(): batch enqueue operation
2. 【Consumer Operations】Pop and pop_slice operations
   - pop(): single item dequeue (check empty → read → advance head)
   - pop_slice(): batch dequeue operation
3. 【Atomic Pointers】head and tail AtomicUsize operations
   - Acquire ordering for reads
   - Release ordering for writes
4. 【Wrapping Behavior】Handle pointer wrapping at usize boundary
   - Use modulo arithmetic for circular indexing
5. 【Empty/Full Detection】
   - Empty: head == tail
   - Full: (tail - head) == capacity
6. 【Lock-Free Progress】
   - Producer can always make progress if buffer not full
   - Consumer can always make progress if buffer not empty

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (do not model):
- Memory segment management (Segment<()>)
- Generic type parameter T details
- VmReader/VmWriter for byte operations
- Frame allocation specifics
- PhantomData implementation details

REQUIRED BEHAVIORAL SCOPE:
- Model head and tail as natural numbers (wrapping handled by modulo)
- Track buffer state (empty/full/partial)
- Model producer and consumer as separate processes
- Ensure atomic visibility of pointer updates
- SPSC semantics: no contention on same pointer

Generate a TLA+ specification that accurately models the ring buffer's concurrent behavior.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "ringbuffer" (---- MODULE ringbuffer ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE ringbuffer ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
6. **DO NOT define invariants** (like MutualExclusion, SafetyProperty, etc.) - focus on modeling the system behavior
7. **MUST include EXTENDS statement**: The specification must extend at least these modules: Naturals, Sequences
8. **MANDATORY Spec Definition with Fairness**: The Spec definition MUST include appropriate fairness assumptions (e.g., WF_Vars for operations or overall progress) to ensure liveness properties.

## Trace Validation Requirements
Your specification must use these EXACT names:
- **Actions**: Create, Split, Push, Pop, PushSlice, PopSlice
- **State variables**: head, tail, capacity
