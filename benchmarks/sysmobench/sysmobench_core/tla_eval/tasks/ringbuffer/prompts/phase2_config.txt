You are a TLA+ expert. Generate a complete TLC configuration file (.cfg) for the ring buffer specification that can be directly saved and used for model checking.

## Input Specification:

$tla_spec

## Generated Invariants:

$invariants

## Requirements:

1. **Analyze the specification** to identify the main specification name and all declared constants
2. **Generate complete .cfg file content** with SPECIFICATION, CONSTANTS, and INVARIANT/PROPERTY sections
3. **Use small values for constants** to ensure efficient model checking (capacity: 4-8, small buffer sizes)
4. **Output ONLY the raw .cfg file content** - no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks

## Example Output Format:

SPECIFICATION SpecName

CONSTANTS
    ...


**CRITICAL: Your response must contain exactly ONE complete .cfg file. Do not repeat any sections. Start your response immediately with "SPECIFICATION" and include nothing else. Each invariant name must be on its own line. Stop immediately after the last invariant name with no additional text.**
