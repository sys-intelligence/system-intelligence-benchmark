    Replace first occurrence of <search> with <replace> in the currently displayed lines.

    For example, if you are looking at this file:

        print("Hello world")

    and you want to edit the file to read:

    def fct():
        print("Hello")

    you can search for `Hello world` and replace with `"Hello"\n    print("world")`
    (note the extra spaces before the print statement!).

    Tips:

    1. Always include proper whitespace/indentation
    2. When you are adding an if/with/try statement, you need to INDENT the block that follows, so make sure to include it in both your search and replace strings!
    3. If you are wrapping code in a try statement, make sure to also add an 'except' or 'finally' block.

    Before every edit, please

    1. Explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem
    2. Explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem
    3. Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality
