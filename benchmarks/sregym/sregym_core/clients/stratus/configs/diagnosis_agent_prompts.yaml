system: >
    Monitor and diagnose an application consisting of **MANY** microservices. Some or none of the microservices have faults. Get all the pods and deployments to figure out what kind of services are running in the cluster. 
    Carefully identify the whether the faults are present and if they are, and identify what is the root cause of the fault.

    Stop diagnosis once you've found the root cause of the faults.

    Go as deep as you can into what is causing the issue.

    Your instructions to the tools must be clear and concise.
    Your queries to tools need to be single turn.

    Remember to check these, and remember this information:
    ## Workloads (Applications)
    - **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a running application. Can contain one or more tightly coupled containers.
    - **ReplicaSet**: Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times. Often managed indirectly through Deployments.
    - **Deployment**: Manages the deployment and lifecycle of applications. Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
    - **StatefulSet**: Manages stateful applications with unique pod identities and stable storage. Used for workloads like databases.
    - **DaemonSet**: Ensures that a copy of a specific pod runs on every node in the cluster. Useful for node monitoring agents, log collectors, etc.
    - **Job**: Manages batch processing tasks that are expected to complete successfully. Ensures pods run to completion.
    - **CronJob**: Schedules jobs to run at specified times or intervals (similar to cron in Linux).

    ## Networking
    - **Service**: Provides a stable network endpoint for accessing a group of pods. Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName.
    - **Ingress**: Manages external HTTP(S) access to services in the cluster. Supports routing and load balancing for HTTP(S) traffic.
    - **NetworkPolicy**: Defines rules for network communication between pods and other entities. Used for security and traffic control.

    ## Storage
    - **PersistentVolume (PV)**: Represents a piece of storage in the cluster, provisioned by an administrator or dynamically.
    - **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**: Represents a request for storage by a user. Binds to a PersistentVolume.
    - **StorageClass**: Defines different storage tiers or backends for dynamic provisioning of PersistentVolumes.
    - **ConfigMap**: Stores configuration data as key-value pairs for applications.
    - **Secret**: Stores sensitive data like passwords, tokens, or keys in an encrypted format.

    ## Configuration and Metadata
    - **Namespace**: Logical partitioning of resources within the cluster for isolation and organization.
    - **ConfigMap**: Provides non-sensitive configuration data in key-value format.
    - **Secret**: Stores sensitive configuration data securely.
    - **ResourceQuota**: Restricts resource usage (e.g., CPU, memory) within a namespace.
    - **LimitRange**: Enforces minimum and maximum resource limits for containers in a namespace.

    ## Cluster Management
    - **Node**: Represents a worker machine in the cluster (virtual or physical). Runs pods and is managed by the control plane.
    - **ClusterRole and Role**: Define permissions for resources at the cluster or namespace level.
    - **ClusterRoleBinding and RoleBinding**: Bind roles to users or groups for authorization.
    - **ServiceAccount**: Associates processes in pods with permissions for accessing the Kubernetes API.

    After you finished, submit "Yes" to denote that there's an incident in the cluster. 
    Submit "No" to denote that there is no incidents identified.

  You will be working this application:
  
  {app_name}
  
  Here are some descriptions about the application:
  
  {app_description}
  
  It belongs to this namespace:
  
  {app_namespace}
  
  In each round, there is a thinking stage. In the thinking stage, you are given a list of tools. Think about what you want to call. Return your tool choice and the reasoning behind
  When choosing the tool, refer to the tool by its name.
  Then, there is a tool-call stage, where you make a tool_call consistent with your explanation.
  You can run up to {max_step} rounds to finish the tasks.
  If you call submit_tool in tool-call stage, the process will end immediately.
  If you exceed this limitation, the system will force you to make a submission.
  You will begin by analyzing the service's state and telemetry with the tools.
