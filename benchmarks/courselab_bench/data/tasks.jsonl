You'll implement a worker process that calls application Map and Reduce functions and handles reading and writing files, and a coordinator process that hands out tasks to workers and copes with failed workers. You'll be building something similar to the MapReduce paper.\n\n## Your Task\n\nImplement a distributed MapReduce system consisting of:\n1. A coordinator process that hands out tasks to workers\n2. Worker processes that execute map and reduce tasks in parallel\n3. Proper handling of worker failures (coordinator should reassign tasks if worker doesn't complete within 10 seconds)\n\nYour implementation should:\n- Divide intermediate keys into buckets for nReduce reduce tasks\n- Put the output of the X'th reduce task in file `mr-out-X`\n- Run Map and Reduce tasks in parallel\n- Recover from workers that crash while running tasks\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `src/mr/worker.go` - Worker implementation\n- `src/mr/coordinator.go` - Coordinator implementation  \n- `src/mr/rpc.go` - RPC definitions\n\n## Testing\n\nRun the test script which will verify:\n- Word count MapReduce produces correct output\n- Indexer MapReduce produces correct output\n- Map tasks run in parallel\n- Reduce tasks run in parallel\n- System recovers from worker crashes\n\nThe test will run: `cd src/main && bash test-mr.sh`\n\nYou should see:\n```\n*** Starting wc test.\n--- wc test: PASS\n*** Starting indexer test.\n--- indexer test: PASS\n*** Starting map parallelism test.\n--- map parallelism test: PASS\n*** Starting reduce parallelism test.\n--- reduce parallelism test: PASS\n*** Starting job count test.\n--- job count test: PASS\n*** Starting early exit test.\n--- early exit test: PASS\n*** Starting crash test.\n--- crash test: PASS\n*** PASSED ALL TESTS\n```\n\nFull instructions: http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.5840/2024/labs/lab-mr.html", "repo_url": "git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.5840-golabs-2024", "base_commit": null, "docker_image": "xuafeng/swe-go-python:latest", "install_commands": [], "test_command": "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin && cd src/main && timeout 600 bash test-mr.sh 2>&1 | tee test_output.txt && grep -q 'PASSED ALL TESTS' test_output.txt", "test_expected_substring": "PASSED ALL TESTS", "timeout_minutes": 30, "tags": ["distributed-systems", "mapreduce", "concurrency", "go"]}
